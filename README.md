# Content Management System (CMS)

Portal for floating projects

This is a content management system I developed for a community named "SCRI" in IIT Mandi wherein professors and students can float projects they are currently working on and notify others of possible open positions. This was solely developed to bring people together to create something big and new. 

<b>Language:</b> PHP, Bootstrap.
